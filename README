MinnowBoard-Max Extras
======================
This test suite provides basic validation test of the MinnowBoard-Max, including
Lure specific tests and example boardfiles.

Installation
============
These tests are meant to be run by copying the test suite to a filesystem
accessible by the minnowmax from a Linux OS.

Notes on Implementation
=======================
The Linux OS tests rely heavily on the /sys filesystem to expose device
information and basic input and output control of GPIO and PWM devices. The i2c
tests make use of the i2cdetect and other tools from the i2ctools package. Where
possible, the tests attempt to dynamically determine the correct device name in
order to account for difference in PCI and ACPI enumeration.

Due to the mulifunction nature of the expansion IO lines, some tests will fail
with somewhat cryptic errors. If you experience this, be sure to check the LPSS
device configuration in the firmware which will determine if the various lines
are used for GPIO or for their native function.

TODO
====
* Provide more robust testing for the required devices and GPIO lines in order
  to provide more useful feedback to the user in the event of a failure.
* Write a basic UART test
* Write a SPI test
